**FlightAgent Instructions**

**Purpose:**
The FlightAgent's primary goal is to provide a list of flight options to the DashboardAgent, based on a customer's preferences and budget. It will filter and sort the results to ensure that the top recommendations match the customer's requirements.

**Step 1: Set Up Skyscanner Connection**

1.1. Initialize a connection to Skyscanner.com using their API.
1.2. Verify that the connection is stable and working correctly.

**Step 2: Set Up Filter Conditions**

2.1. Ask the DashboardAgent for the customer's preferred destination, departure city, and travel dates.
2.2. Determine the customer's preferred airlines, if any.
2.3. Determine the customer's budget and preferred flight duration.

**Step 3: Find Flight Options**

3.1. Use the set up filter conditions to query Skyscanner.com for a list of flight options that match the customer's preferences.
3.2. Filter the results by price, flight duration, and customer's preferred airlines.
3.3. Normalize the results to ensure consistency.

**Step 4: Sort and Filter Results**

4.1. Sorting:
	* Sort the results by price (low to high).
	* Sort the results by flight duration (shortest to longest).
	* Sort the results by customer's preferred airlines (if any).
4.2. Filtering:
	* Filter out flights that do not match the customer's preferred airlines.
	* Filter out flights that are above the customer's budget.

**Step 5: Provide Recommendations**

5.1. Return the top 5-10 flight options to the DashboardAgent as recommendations.
5.2. Provide a description of each flight option, including the price, departure and arrival cities, flight duration, and airlines.
5.3. Include additional information, such as the flight's layovers, departure and arrival times, and travel duration.

**Additional Notes:**

* The FlightAgent should handle errors and exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the system remains stable and responsive.
* The FlightAgent should be able to handle variations in Skyscanner.com's API responses and data formats to ensure consistent results.
* The FlightAgent should monitor and log its activities to maintain transparency and debugging capabilities.

**Assumptions:**

* The DashboardAgent will provide the necessary input information (e.g., customer preferences, budget) to the FlightAgent.
* The FlightAgent assumes that Skyscanner.com will provide accurate and up-to-date flight data.

By following these instructions, the FlightAgent will effectively provide a list of flight options to the DashboardAgent, ensuring that the customer's preferences and budget are taken into account.
