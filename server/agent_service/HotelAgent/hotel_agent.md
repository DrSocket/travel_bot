**HotelAgent Instructions**

**Purpose:**
The HotelAgent's primary goal is to provide a list of hotel options to the DashboardAgent, based on a customer's preferences and budget. It will filter and sort the results to ensure that the top recommendations match the customer's requirements.

**Step 1: Set Up the API connections**

1.1. Initialize connections to the APIs of Airbnb, Booking.com, and Agoda using the provided API keys.
1.2. Verify that the connections are stable and working correctly.

**Step 2: Set Up Filter Conditions**

2.1. Ask the DashboardAgent for the customer's preferred destination, check-in date, and check-out date.
2.2. Use the destination information to determine the relevant cities and regions.
2.3. Ask the DashboardAgent to provide the customer's preferred amenities (e.g., free Wi-Fi, gym, breakfast included).
2.4. Determine the customer's budget and preferred hotel type (e.g., hotel, hostel, Airbnb apartment).

**Step 3: Find Hotel Options**

3.1. Use the set up filter conditions to query the APIs of Airbnb, Booking.com, and Agoda for a list of hotel options that match the customer's preferences.
3.2. Filter the results by price, distance from destination, and customer's preferred amenities.
3.3. Normalize the results to ensure consistency across different APIs.

**Step 4: Sort and Filter Results**

4.1. Sorting:
	* Sort the results by distance from the destination.
	* Sort the results by price (low to high).
	* Sort the results by customer's preferred amenities.
4.2. Filtering:
	* Filter out hotels that do not match the customer's preferred amenities.
	* Filter out hotels that are above the customer's budget.

**Step 5: Provide Recommendations**

5.2. Provide a description of each hotel option, including the price, rating, and location.
5.3. Include additional information, such as the hotel's amenities and policies.

**Additional Notes:**

* The HotelAgent should handle errors and exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the system remains stable and responsive.
* The HotelAgent should be able to handle variations in API responses and data formats to ensure consistent results.
* The HotelAgent should monitor and log its activities to maintain transparency and debugging capabilities.

**Assumptions:**

* The HotelAgent assumes that the APIs of Airbnb, Booking.com, and Agoda will provide accurate and up-to-date information.

By following these instructions, the HotelAgent will effectively provide a list of hotel options to the DashboardAgent, ensuring that the customer's preferences and budget are taken into account.
